                    <td><p>Kady is not as of yet in the computer world in a professional sense, but she does have a passion for forgotten, underrated, and plentiful cheap computer systems and keeping them out of the landfills and e-waste centers as much as possible. She is a transwoman who currently resides in Indianapolis, IN with her husband and three cats. She is an alumna of Purdue University, receiving a Bachelor of Arts in Education. She currently works in the Cooperative Extension Service and is currently pursuing both an Associates/Bachelors in IT through Purdue Global and completing Eleven Fifty Academy's Software Development track.</p></td>
                    <td><p>This project is inspired by a personal passion from Kady, in that there is an ever-growing world of e-waste that contains perfectly useful and functional devices. The goal of this project is to keep as many computers out of landfills and e-waste centers as possible, to both lesson the impact we have on the harvesting of rare earth materials used in electronics and reduce the impact after computers have been discarded. This project aims to provide documentation, in the form of wiring diagrams, 3-D models, if needed, and how-to guides to getting the most out of your Dell/HP/Lenovo/Whatever computer. While this project is called "Open Optiplex Project" the scope is not limited to Dell Optiplex systems; that just happened to be what Kady was most familiar with as of the creation of the website in August 2023.</p></td>
